      1. Cascade The Cascading part of CSS means that when more than one rule
      applies to the same element, 
      CSS decides which one to apply using a priority system. 
      Cascade depends on 3 things: Importance → !important wins
      over everything. 
      Specificity → how specific the selector is. Source order
      → if two rules have same importance & specificity, the one written last in
      CSS wins.

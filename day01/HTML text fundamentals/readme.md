# HTML Text Fundamentals

This document explains the basic concepts of working with text in HTML. These fundamentals help in structuring and formatting text properly on a webpage.

---

## 1. Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
Headings define titles and subtitles.  
- `<h1>` is the largest and most important heading.  
- `<h6>` is the smallest heading.  

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Sub Title</h2>
<h3>Smaller Heading</h3>

2. Paragraphs (<p>)

Paragraphs are used for normal blocks of text.

<p>This is a paragraph of text in HTML.</p>

3. Line Breaks (<br>)

A line break moves text to the next line without starting a new paragraph.

<p>Hello<br>World</p>

4. Text Formatting

    <b> or <strong> → Bold text

    <i> or <em> → Italic text

    <u> → Underlined text

<p>This is <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and <u>underlined</u>.</p>

5. Lists
Ordered List (<ol>) – Numbered

<ol>
  <li>Step one</li>
  <li>Step two</li>
</ol>

Unordered List (<ul>) – Bulleted

<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
</ul>

6. Preformatted Text (<pre>)

The <pre> tag preserves spaces, tabs, and line breaks exactly as written.

<pre>
This   text
    stays   as  it is.
</pre>

7. Quotations and Citations

    <blockquote> → Large quotation block

    <q> → Short inline quotation

    <cite> → Reference to a source

<blockquote>"This is a long quotation."</blockquote>
<p>He said, <q>Hello there!</q></p>
<cite>— From a famous book</cite>
